# bayes-treesurv-gp
This code performs Bayesian conditional survival analysis by using a tree
to partition the covariate space and then fits flexible survival
curves in each partition element. Details are outlined in the paper entitle "A Bayesian Survival Treed Hazards Model Using Latent Gaussian Processes" which is accepted in *Biometrics*.

NOTE: Be sure the GPstuff toolbox is included in the Matlab path.
